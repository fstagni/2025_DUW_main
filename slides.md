            Q2 2025 : LHCb deploys in production alpha versions of DIRAC (v9.0.0aX) and DiracX (v0.0.1aX)
                    : All existing DiracX components are tested and extended.
                    : Several scalability and performance issues were addressed
        section DIRAC and DiracX coexisting (forcefully)
            Last week (Sept 2025) : Release of DIRAC v9.0 and DiracX 0.0.1
                                  : JobStateUpdate service migrated and tested
                                  : Possible adoption by non-LHCb DIRAC users
```

:: right ::

- We kept doing 2-days hackathons every quarter
  - if not during workshops, at CERN, and with good participation
- DIRAC v8 kept receiving updates, but most of them were "for DiracX" 
- In April 2025 LHCb moved the production setup to DIRAC v9 and DiracX 0.0.1 alpha versions
- We kept postponing "real" releases for excellent technical reasons, until last week, when we tagged the first non-alpha versions of v9 and DiracX

# Getting to **DiracX 0.0.1**

:: left ::

## This first release contains:
* All service/client underpinnings
* Extension support
* Jobs sandboxes can be stored in an object store (and you should do it)
* The DIRAC `WorkloadManagement/JobStateUpdateHandler` service can be replaced by an "equivalent" DiracX service
* The helm chart is considered "stable enough"
* Documentation "sufficiently complete"

We will keep working, within the patches of this first version, on adding new services and documentation.


:: right ::

## DiracX brings a new "mindset":
* a cloud-native app
* from "in-house" to "standing-on-the-shoulders"

```

:: right ::

- There are developments done by stagiare that could not be included in DiracX's first release
- DiracX 0.1.0 will bring "tasks", for replacing DIRAC's *agents*, *executors*, and the RMS machinery (the *RequestExecutingAgent*)
- We will need a DIRAC v9.1 because there will be database changes (some PRs already in *draft*)

## **notes**

- Dear friends administrator of DIRAC's installations, you have one year to migrate to DiracX
- There's a lot of guesswork in understanding how things will be in one year time, and even more in what will happen after
- This community **needs** to work together as much as possible

# The long road to DiracX v1


:: content ::

After **DiracX 0.1.0** (the one bringing *tasks* to DiracX, coming **Q1 2026**) there are many areas that will be "free to proceed" ([roadmap](https://diracx.diracgrid.org/en/latest/roadmap/)), in parallel:

<ul class="text-sm">
  <li>WMS
    <ul>
      <li>Pilots machinery (in DIRAC terms: SiteDirectors, Matcher)
        <ul>
          <li>this needs to include "Computing Resources"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Jobs description (adoption of CWL)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>DMS (effectively needed for WMS to work)
    <ul>
      <li>this needs to include "Storage Resources" and "Catalog Resources"
        <ul>
          <li>DiracX to Rucio bridge</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>RSS (effectively needed for WMS to work)</li>
  <li>RMS</li>
  <li>TS (also CWL)
    <ul>
      <li>DIRAC also provides a generic Production System</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Accounting and Monitoring</li>
</ul>

<ul class="text-sm">
  <li>Caveats:
    <ul>
      <li>moving a DIRAC service to a DiracX one</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

### DiracX brings updates for

### As of now:
- we are more concerned about solving **administrator**'s issues.
- **Developers** "need to know" already if you have an DIRAC (or WebAppDIRAC) extension.

# What's new for users

:: content ::

<ul class="text-sm">
  <li><strong>Logging-in</strong> requires that you are previously registered in an IdP implementing OpenID Connect protocol
    <ul>
      <li>essentially this is the VOMS-&gt;IaM migration. Admins should have done this already, transparently, for all the users of a VO</li>
      <li>if a VO is not migrated to IaM, it can't be "enabled" (see later on)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New <strong>Web app</strong> (which, for DiracX 0.1 will not be of much use)</li>
  <li>Enriched and modern <strong>CLI</strong> (but not many functionalities in there)</li>
  <li><strong>REST</strong> interface for programmatic usage (for advanced users -- but again, not much user-facing info to use)</li>
</ul>

<p>But effectively, for now <strong>users can largely be agnostic</strong> of DiracX, as for the first version users' interactions will still be done via the DIRAC tools they know (and love?).</p>

<p>Also, users should be setting the correct environment variables (<code>DIRACX_URL</code> mostly)</p>

1. Logging in (using the `diracx cli`):

```bash
‚ùØ dirac login gridpp
Logging in with scopes: ['vo:gridpp']
Now go to: https://diracx-cert.app.cern.ch/api/auth/device?user_code=XYZXYZXYZ
...Saved credentials to /home/fstagni/.cache/diracx/credentials.json
Login successful!
```

2. Submitting a job (using Python `requests`):

```python
import requests

requests.post('https://diracx-cert.app.cern.ch/api/jobs/', headers={'accept': 'application/json', 'Authorization': 'Bearer eyJhbG...', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}, json=jdl)
```

3. Getting its status (using `curl`):

````md magic-move
```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://diracx-cert.app.cern.ch/api/jobs/status?job_ids=8971' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbG...'  | jq
```
```json
{
  "8971": {
    "Status": "Done",
    "MinorStatus": "Execution Complete",
    "ApplicationStatus": "Unknown"

# Tools

:: content ::

Architecturally, you can't run DiracX without:
<ul class="text-sm">
  <li>MySQL (or MariaDB) (this you always had -- no need to touch it)
    <ul>
      <li>DiracX 0.0.1 has only one new DB <code>DiracXAuthDB</code> (containing tokens)</li>
      <li><em>NOTE</em>: we tried to use PostgreSQL as an alternative to MySQL, and failed because of "data format" issues, and won't retry in the near future.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>OpenSearch (you <em>should</em> have it already)</li>
  <li>Kubernetes (<strong>NEW</strong>)</li>
  <li>S3-compatible object store (<strong>NEW</strong>)</li>
  <li>a Grafana instance (not immediately, but will be needed)</li>
  <li>OTEL (not immediately, but maybe you will want to have it)</li>
</ul>

so, make sure the above are up and running as-a-service.

<AdmonitionType type="important" width="700px">
The central team can not fully help in setting up any of the above.

  </h2>
  <p>
    Dear friends, admins of DIRAC installations,
  </p>
  <p>
    By these humble words I address thee, as was the custom in times of old.
    You are not there to bother yourself with K3S or MinIO,
    or other infrastructure stuff.
    

    So, 
    
    -> DO use "services".
    -> DO get together, join forces!

    Can some of the institute part of your international collaboration
    host DiracX services? 
    Maybe CERN ?

  </p>
  <p style="text-align:right; margin-top:20px;">
    With love and affection<br>
  </p>
</div>

# What is in practice needed to migrate to v9?

:: content ::

Use this [skeleton](https://codimd.web.cern.ch/5C44tUJTReacVOcIn_0Bfg#)

NB:
- There's quite some preparatory work, and anyway you should do it first on your test setup
- You will need to adapt the skeleton above to your needs (copy-paste-edit)
  - To avoid mistakes, atm this skeleton is "locked" - meaning that only the owner (fstagni) can edit
    - might re-open for this workshop if many contributors
- There are **many** database changes/updates
  - the order in which they are done inside the upgrade guide is meaningful, do not change the order!
- **You will need a downtime** (at a minimum, do not let users or agents submit new jobs)
  - no need to completely drain the system before: the running jobs will *eventually* complete

- Since DiracX can't reliably depend on DIRAC without triggering DIRAC's global state initialization
- Lives [inside DIRAC code](https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/tree/integration/dirac-common)
- Every time DIRAC is tagged, DIRACCommon is tagged too (yes, a bit of an overkill...)
- Do `pip install DIRACCommon` in your local DIRAC conda environment now
  - **maybe** you will need a `extensionDIRACCommon` package, but most probably not

# On developing DiracX

Start with the "Getting Started" guide here on the right. for which you'll basically only need [pixi](https://pixi.sh) -- `pixi` is what DiracX is using instead of conda/mamba/etc (it's basically its successor)

To go further, remember that:
- for developing databases, you should have a grasp of [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
  - we do not use the ORM, just the **Core** part
- In order to develop routers (the "services"), you should have a grasp of [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- DiracX uses [typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) and [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for beautiful CLI
- In general, you should have an idea about [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)

title: Client
url: https://diracx.diracgrid.org/en/latest/dev/how-to/client-generation/
class: Client
slide_info: false
color: gray-light
align: lm
---

Since `FastAPI` includes built-in support for [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3) specifications, the `client` can be generated by [autorest](https://github.com/Azure/AutoRest)

- several languages suppported. Within the DiracX repo we include the python client
  - if you want to generate a client in another language (e.g. because your third-party application is developed in Java or Go), you are one CI item away
- depending on what you do, the client will need to be regenerated
  - e.g. if you change one route

# Today's developments (what you can do **NOW**)

:: content ::

few notes:
1. if you do not feel like studying stuff like SQLAlchemy or FastAPI, there are still many maintenance tasks to do, e.g.
  - improve the CIs
  - documentation (which can be sometime auto-created)
2. the diracx-charts need improvements (won't be covered within this presentation)
3. diracx-web will be covered later today
4. developing a route in diracx is a necessary step for being used, but it is not enough:
  - a *Legacy Adaptor* will need to be added to DIRAC
  - some refactoring to DIRAC will probably be necessary

# Testing DiracX

:: content ::

Even if Github CIs will do every "everything", if you want to run integration tests for DiracX locally, you can:

- Run a local `uvicorn` server with default configuration: (???? works??)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DIRACGrid/diracx
cd diracx
mamba create --name my-diracx-env
conda activate my-diracx-env
pip install requirements-dev.txt
./run_local.sh
```

SQL DBs are in `SQLite` (no similar option for OpenSearch, so still using sqlite).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Run the demo**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DIRACGrid/diracx-charts
./diracx-charts/run_demo.sh # this is run for each and every commit in Github Actions
pytest --demo-dir=../diracx-charts/

# DiracX Web API

<AdmonitionType type='caution' >
What is on the right is the certification Web API (VOs: `dteam` and `gridpp`), loaded live. Use with caution!
</AdmonitionType>

DIRAC Web APIs with <devicon-fastapi-wordmark class="text-7xl align-middle inline-block mx-0"></devicon-fastapi-wordmark>

<ul class="text-sm">
  <li>
    Nicely documented by 
    <devicon-swagger-wordmark class="text-7xl align-middle inline-block mx-0"></devicon-swagger-wordmark>
    <ul class="text-xs ml-4">
      <li class="text-xs">--> this is what you see on the right</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Follows the <devicon-plain-openapi-wordmark class="text-7xl align-middle inline-block mx-1"></devicon-plain-openapi-wordmark> specification, with the (python) client generated by <a href="https://github.com/Azure/autorest/blob/main/docs/introduction.md">AutoREST</a>.
  </li>
</ul>


<!-- 
- there is also redoc
- AutoREST supports several langagues, not only python

# DiracX web

We are also rewriting [the Web App](https://github.com/DIRACGrid/diracx-web) from scratch, see the pres from Ryun later today

Software stack:
- NextJS <devicon-nextjs-wordmark class="text-4xl align-middle inline-block mx-2" />
- Material UI <devicon-materialui class="text-3xl align-middle inline-block mx-2" />
- TypeScript <devicon-typescript class="text-3xl align-middle inline-block mx-2" />
